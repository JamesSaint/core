<h2>Chapter 1 – The Departure (January – May 2020)</h2>
<p>In January 2020 I signed away the house that had carried so many unfinished hopes. The papers were done, the money hit my account, and for a moment I thought I’d created a clean start. I was scared, but I had a plan: three months with my old business partner, Nick, time to rest, to think, to rebuild.</p>
<p>Nick’s house in Godalming was quiet and ordered—too ordered for a man falling apart. At first I tried to match their rhythm, pretending I still belonged in a normal world. But the seams were already tearing. His partner Peter and I rubbed against each other until friction became fire. By May I knew I couldn’t stay.</p>
<p>I packed a couple of bags, grabbed Paddy, and called a taxi. We drove into the fading light, nowhere to go, just away. That night we slept in Molesey Heath—me, my dog, and a sky that didn’t care whether I woke up. I was homeless, frightened, and unwell. The police found me, worried, and called my family. My sister reached out; my father and I spoke briefly. I apologised for the worry, for everything really.</p>
<p>She helped me find a Travelodge that would take dogs. It wasn’t home, but it was a roof. I arrived late, heart hammering, and fell into a bed that smelled of disinfectant and cheap hope.</p>
</section>

<section id="ch2" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 2 – Lockdown Exile (May – October 2020)</h2>
<p>From the edge of that hotel bed I tried to build a life again. I bought a van over the phone—cash, delivered to the car park. The driver’s wife followed him in another car and waved as if this were normal. The van became both shelter and symbol: I had wheels, therefore I existed.</p>
<p>I registered the van at Nick’s address, the last fixed point I had, and called the GP surgery there. I rang the Citizens Advice Bureau. Everyone was polite, nobody could help. It was early lockdown; the world had frozen.</p>
<p>The Travelodge was full of ghosts—other displaced souls, addicts, the government’s homeless-relief project. I didn’t feel safe. I moved to another hotel in Frimley that would take Paddy. From there I called every number I could find: councils, crisis teams, mental-health lines. People answered from spare bedrooms, promised to pass messages on. Nothing ever came back.</p>
<p>One day I met a community-mental-health worker named Becky in a park in Godalming. We stood under a bandstand six feet apart, pretending distance was protection. She tried to help but the system was paralysed. Without a permanent address I wasn’t anyone’s responsibility. I understood the logic even as it broke me.</p>
<p>So I made the van my base. When hotels were full, I slept in lay-bys or the edge of a stately-home drive. Paddy curled beside me. I learned how silence can roar when you’re alone long enough.</p>
<p>Eventually I found a house for sale. I’d looked before, back when I’d been staying with Nick, and there was one that had stuck in my mind—a new build with a south-facing garden. By summer 2020 the world was still shuttered, viewings were done by video, but I told myself speed was everything. The sellers were chain-free, I was a cash buyer. My solicitor warned me about the listing—<em>garage and parking</em> that wasn’t really parking—but I was too tired to care.</p>
<p>I completed on October 1st 2020. I drove my own van to collect my storage boxes, loaded everything myself, and moved in. I remember standing in that empty living room, the keys cold in my hand, thinking: <em>I made it. I’m home.</em></p>
<p>The neighbours appeared—Sheila and Dennis from No. 4, David and Christine from No. 8—smiling through the strange fear of lockdown. Sheila warned me, almost kindly, that the summers were “hell” because of the family behind me and their footballs. I laughed politely. Hours later the thud of leather on fence started, and I understood exactly what she meant.</p>
<p>The house smelled wrong—damp, urine, rot. I pulled up carpet, unscrewed sockets, tore into plasterboard hunting for the source. When I realised the soil outside sat above the damp course I smashed half the wall away to see the damage. That night I broke.</p>
<p>David knocked on the door, saw me on the floor amid dust and tears, and sat with me. He could smell it too, could see the ruin the sellers had hidden. For a moment I wasn’t invisible.</p>
<p>The next morning I started patching the hole, lowering the soil, telling myself I could fix everything. I couldn’t, but the act of trying kept me alive a little longer.</p>
</section>

<section id="ch3" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 3 – The House and the Neighbours (October 2020 – February 2021)</h2>
<p>By winter, the quiet street that had promised refuge became a cage. The house still smelled of damp even after I’d patched the wall and scrubbed every surface. Every time I stepped outside, the noise returned—children screaming, balls slamming against the fence, a drumbeat of intrusion.</p>
<p>The back garden had been the reason I bought the place. It faced south, felt private, or could have. But the family behind treated the dividing fence as a goalpost. I’d hear the thud of leather, the whoop of voices, the shudder of impact against timber, hour after hour. The sound found its way inside me until my body clenched on instinct whenever it started.</p>
<p>David, the neighbour who’d once sat on my floor, became a familiar figure. He’d wander over under the guise of small talk, and I’d try to hold it together. One evening he knocked and found me undone again—crying, desperate, surrounded by half-finished repairs. I told him everything in a jumble: the smell, the noise, the exhaustion. He listened. He knew the previous owners had fought with those same neighbours. The history had been passed down like a curse.</p>
<p>I patched the wall again, lowered the ground outside, filled holes, painted over the damage. The house still felt unclean, but the rhythm of work gave me something to do. Amazon boxes piled up: filler, paint, disinfectant, screws, everything delivered because shops were shut. The national mood had turned grim. Briefings blared from every screen, the fear thick in the air. I absorbed it all.</p>
<p>I registered with the local GP and tried to explain how unwell I was—mentally, physically, emotionally. I spoke to a GP named <strong>Dr. Denby</strong>. I tried to explain my PTSD, that it dated back to 2016 when Julia died, and that the lockdown had reactivated everything. He replied with one word that stuck: “Still?” It landed like contempt.</p>
<p>After that I stopped trying to talk. I closed the door and shut down. Fireworks exploded that November, the bangs from nearby gardens merging with the football thuds and children’s shouts. My body reacted before my mind could. The sound hit my amygdala like an electric shock.</p>
<p>By December I was barely functioning. I received a letter: a phone assessment with the mental-health team, referred by Becky from Waverley Community Services. I was to be assessed over the phone—<em>due to COVID precautions</em>. The letter sat on the table for days before I opened it. When I finally spoke to them, I told the truth as best I could: that I couldn’t cope, that I was isolated, that every sound outside felt like an attack.</p>
<p>They documented it all, tidy clinical notes about a man with “long-standing PTSD and agoraphobia, not associating with other people.” They didn’t seem to hear that I was disappearing.</p>
<p>In February a letter arrived with a psychiatrist’s name: <strong>Dr. Denzel Mitchell</strong>. He would call me on March 24th, 2021. I marked it on the calendar like a lifeline.</p>
</section>

<section id="ch4" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 4 – Collapse (March – July 2021)</h2>
<p>The letter said a psychiatrist would call me on March 24th. I waited like a man at the end of a rope. When Dr Denzel Mitchell finally rang, I tried to explain what my life felt like inside that house. The fear. The noise. The shut curtains. The body that would not settle. I told him I was drowning. He dictated a summary that later turned up in my post. It said I had long-standing PTSD, agoraphobia, and chronic anxiety. It said I preferred remote appointments and home delivery of medication. It said I had slipped into withdrawal after a short diazepam script from a colleague, which he took as evidence of dependence. It recommended olanzapine and zopiclone and asked my GP to keep the diazepam going.</p>
<p>I read those lines and felt small. I did not feel seen. I felt inventoried. Labels and plans. No one in the room. No one in my house. No one watching how my nervous system was stuck on a high setting I could not switch off.</p>
<p>Spring crept in. The country kept talking about vaccines like they were a ticket back to life. I was alone, frightened, and desperate for a door back to people. The GP surgery arranged home visits. Two nurses arrived at my front door with brisk smiles. They did not ask me how I was coping. They did not explain risk. They came in, prepared the syringes, told me to roll my sleeve up, and injected me. It took seconds. They left as quickly as they came. I remember standing in the hallway after the door closed and wondering what had just happened.</p>
<p>Weeks later they came back for the second dose. Same speed. Same silence. No conversation about alternatives. No space for consent. Bish, bosh, bang. See you later. That is how it felt. It landed in my body like a judgement.</p>
<p>I tried to keep going. Phone calls. Slow walks with Paddy when I could make it to the door. The thud of footballs next door. The angle grinder from the other side. The house that still smelled wrong no matter what I cleaned.</p>
<p>By July I spoke to Dr Mitchell again. He wrote that my anxiety had worsened and that my diazepam dose needed to increase. He noted that the change was due to several things. The pressure of the pandemic, the lack of progress in my life, and the effects of the Covid vaccination on my physical health. That line stayed with me. It was the first time I saw any acknowledgement on paper that my body had been hit hard. He suggested duloxetine to help reduce the diazepam. He promised a support worker for graded exposure. He wrote that psychological therapy could be considered once I was more stable. Nothing arrived. No support worker. No therapy. Only the pills and the phone.</p>
<p>In my calls with him I tried to name the truth. I said my body was wrecked. I said it felt like something had torn through me. He wondered out loud if the vaccine had triggered my old myalgic symptoms. I did not have the words for what was really happening inside my head. I only had images. I told him it felt like someone had hooked a giant fishhook through the left side of my skull and dragged my nervous system three feet above my body. I could feel myself slipping. Thought by thought. Movement by movement. I was present enough to report it and too unwell to make anyone hear it.</p>
<p>Somewhere in that same window the service changed hands. Dr Mitchell moved on. Continuity vanished. I was handed to a new name on a list. The phone would ring again, but it would not bring someone who knew my voice or the sound of my breathing. It would bring another rotation of scripts and a system that could file me without seeing me.</p>
<p>This is where the floor began to give way.</p>
</section>

<section id="ch5" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 5 – The Descent (July 2021 – January 2022)</h2>
<p>After Dr Mitchell left, I was assigned to a new psychiatrist, Dr Temi Oyeyemedi. Our first call was in October 2021. His tone was brisk, his words clipped. I was already hanging by a thread, but in his voice I heard dismissal. I tried to explain that my body felt hijacked, that the pain and the fog were unbearable, that I couldn’t think or move. He cut through my sentences, his manner cold. By the time the call ended I felt erased.</p>
<p>Those months were a slow death in instalments. I could barely wash myself. I couldn’t think clearly enough to read or watch television. Every nerve in my body felt lit from within. The left side of my head burned and buzzed as if electricity ran through it. I would lie in bed for hours, unable to move, trying to quiet a nervous system that refused to obey.</p>
<p>I remember turning off my phone one night and curling up on the bed convinced that I was about to die. I waited for it. I didn’t want another morning. But morning came, and Paddy needed feeding, and the simple truth of his need reached me when nothing else could. He looked at me with those soft, steady eyes, and I realised he was the only reason I was still here. I got up for him, not for me.</p>
<p>The world outside still frightened me. Each attempt to walk him ended with panic—dogs rushing up, people too close, every noise a threat. I withdrew again, living behind drawn curtains, surviving in a small radius from bed to kettle to back door. The pain stayed, the exhaustion deepened. No follow-up. No examination. No one connecting the dots that a stroke had already happened inside my skull.</p>
<p>I tried to make sense of it on my own. I wrote down every symptom, every flash of pain. I convinced myself it might be Guillain-Barré syndrome; I’d read that vaccines could trigger it. I phoned the Guillain-Barré charity and spoke to a kind woman who said my symptoms sounded similar but that, by now, any markers would have disappeared. She couldn’t diagnose, only listen. Even that small act of being heard felt like medicine.</p>
<p>I stayed indoors through the rest of 2021. The nights were long and silent except for the pounding in my head. Then one day, somewhere near the end of the year, I listened to an audiobook—Laura Doddsworth’s <em>A State of Fear</em>. Hearing her voice describe how fear had been used to control the public during the pandemic cracked something open in me. It named what I had felt all along: that the terror around me wasn’t natural, it was cultivated. For the first time in months, I felt sane.</p>
<p>The relief was mixed with fury. Realising how deliberately fear had been sown made my isolation make sense, but it also underlined how cruelly I’d been left to fend for myself. Every text from the GP urging another jab, every message from my sister asking if I’d had my booster, landed like proof that the world had moved on and I hadn’t. So I stopped replying. I disappeared.</p>
<p>Only Paddy remained—a silent witness, breathing beside me, keeping me tethered to life.</p>
<p>By the start of 2022, another pain began under my jaw. My submandibular gland had swollen again, pus leaking into my mouth. I remembered the surgery years earlier, the tiny tool the professor had used to spare me a scar. Now the duct was blocked again. I phoned the GP for antibiotics, swallowed them, and a few days later passed a hard white stone—five millimetres long, jagged as guilt. The infection cleared, but the deeper sickness did not.</p>
<p>By then I was taking forty milligrams of diazepam a day and zopiclone each night just to keep my heart from racing out of my chest. I was a ghost moving through the rooms of a house I no longer recognised. And yet somewhere beneath the chemicals and the noise, a thought began to form: <em>if I stay on these pills, the system still owns me</em>.</p>
<p>That thought would become the next battle—the long, painful withdrawal that would either destroy me or give me back my name.</p>
</section>

<section id="ch6" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 6 – Withdrawal (February – November 2022)</h2>
<p>By February 2022 I was held together by pills and habit. Forty milligrams of diazepam a day, zopiclone at night, and a house that barely felt real. I couldn’t drive safely, couldn’t focus long enough to read, and couldn’t imagine any future that didn’t include another refill slip from the GP.</p>
<p>One night, restless and angry, I started searching online. That’s how I found <strong>Professor Heather Ashton’s manual</strong> on benzodiazepine withdrawal. I read about GABA receptors, dependency, the way the brain down-regulates its own calming chemistry until it can’t function without the drug. I realised that what I had called “my anxiety” might simply be my body’s reaction to a substance it had never learned to live without.</p>
<p>The manual described how to come off slowly. It said the process would take months, even a year, and that it would feel worse before it felt better. It warned of insomnia, crawling sensations under the skin, heightened pain, and surges of fear. It also promised that freedom was possible.</p>
<p>I decided I would do it alone. There was no doctor I trusted, and every official channel had already failed me. I began the slow arithmetic of cutting tablets. From forty milligrams to thirty-five. From thirty-five to thirty. Each reduction brought new withdrawal storms: nights without sleep, muscles twitching, a fizzing in my skin like static electricity. The less medication I took, the louder my nerves screamed.</p>
<p>At times I could feel every thread of pain in my body. It was as if the drugs had been muting the real injury underneath—the neurological damage I hadn’t known how to name. My head burned, my limbs trembled, my thoughts jolted like faulty wiring.</p>
<p>The months blurred together. I filled pages with notes about doses and symptoms. When I hit the halfway mark, I wanted to give up. But something stubborn in me kept going. Each small reduction was a step away from the system that had sedated me into silence.</p>
<p>Spring became summer, and I kept at it: thirty milligrams, twenty-five, twenty, ten. My sleep vanished entirely for stretches. I felt ants under my skin, electricity in my bones, a constant hum in my head. I barely ate, but my mind began to clear. For the first time in years I could see the outlines of myself again.</p>
<p>By late autumn I was down to half a milligram. I remember sitting on the edge of my bed with the last fragment of a tablet in my palm. I looked at it for a long time and decided that was it. I swallowed it dry and knew the next dose would be nothing.</p>
<p>The nights that followed were brutal. I didn’t sleep. My body ached in new places. But I was free. I had done what no doctor or service had managed to help me do. I was clear of the drugs that had kept me in chains.</p>
<p>When the worst of the physical withdrawal passed, I looked around at what remained. The house was still bare, the world still uncertain, but I was awake in it. For the first time in years, I felt the faint, clean pain of reality rather than the numb ache of sedation.</p>
<p>I told myself I’d lost another year, but at least this time the loss had purpose.</p>
</section>

<section id="ch7" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 7 – Reclamation (November 2022 – February 2023)</h2>
<p>When the fog of withdrawal began to lift, the world came back in pieces—light through a window, the sound of the sea miles away, the weight of Paddy’s head on my knee. I was still frightened of leaving the house, still in pain, but there was a small sense of agency again. I could decide what to do with a day.</p>
<p>It started with the garden. One November morning I looked out at the overgrown patch of land behind the house and thought, <em>If I can’t fix myself, maybe I can fix this.</em> The grass had choked out the soil, the shrubs had turned feral, and rubble from the builders was buried under the surface. I wanted a place where Paddy and I could sit in the sun come spring.</p>
<p>I began slowly. My muscles screamed when I lifted the first spade of soil, but the rhythm of physical work gave my mind something it hadn’t had in years: focus. Bucket by bucket I dug, unearthed bricks, nails, twisted metal, and chunks of timber the builders had simply buried. Fourteen tons in total, carried by hand into the one-ton bags that a local company—Webb’s Waste—came to collect. Each bag they hauled away felt like a layer of damage removed from both the ground and me.</p>
<p>The neighbours never changed. The kids behind the fence still screamed and kicked their footballs. The man on the other side, David, still filled the air with the howl of his angle grinder and leaf blower. Ninety-six decibels of DIY from eight in the morning until evening. I tried to see it as background noise, but most days it felt like punishment. Paddy had learned to fear the sound of their voices; at the first shout he would bolt back inside.</p>
<p>Still, I kept digging. When my body couldn’t take it, I hired help. A tree-maintenance crew came to reduce the overgrown hedges, and one of them gave me the number of a fence builder. The fence I had was rotting, leaning, a perfect metaphor for how things had been. In February 2023, after months of scraping money together, I hired him to put up a new boundary—concrete posts, concrete gravel boards, uniform panels running in a straight, solid line.</p>
<p>The day it went up, the garden looked smaller but cleaner, defined. I stood there in the cold and thought: <em>This is mine. This line is mine.</em> It wasn’t happiness exactly, but it was a beginning.</p>
<p>The work rebuilt more than the garden. My body, weak from years of illness and medication, started to find strength again. The ache in my muscles was honest; it came from effort, not injury. I could see shape in my arms again. I started sleeping a little, the kind of sleep that comes after real work rather than from a pill.</p>
<p>It was the first time in a long while that my actions created visible change. I had dug out the buried rubble and replaced it with order. I’d drawn a line around my space. It was a small act of reclamation, but it was mine.</p>
</section>

<section id="ch8" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 8 – Searching for Connection (2023 – 2024)</h2>
<p>When the fence went up, the garden looked finished, but inside me there was still emptiness. The noise from the neighbours, the cost-of-living headlines, the endless grey skies — it all pressed in. I had done everything I could to rebuild a space, yet what I really wanted was another person who could see me. Not pity me. See me.</p>
<p>Money was becoming tight. The government called it a cost-of-living crisis; to me it felt like the slow tightening of a noose. My savings drained with each repair, each delivery, each bill. I looked at my van and thought about the work I used to do — heating, plumbing, electrics. On paper, I was still a qualified gas engineer, though all my certifications had expired.</p>
<p>I started following a local training company online, <strong>Hampshire Training and Assessments</strong>, the kind of place that refreshed engineers’ qualifications. I thought, <em>maybe I can’t crawl under floorboards anymore, but I can teach</em>. I knew my trade inside out. Maybe I could train new entrants and earn an income that didn’t destroy my body.</p>
<p>One day I just walked in. A man named Pat met me at the door, and I told him my story — that I wasn’t well, that my qualifications had lapsed, but that I wanted to contribute. He introduced me to the owner, who liked my initiative. They gave me a chance: sit in on a few training sessions, watch how the instructors work. For the first time in years, I walked into a building full of people.</p>
<p>For a week or two, I shadowed the trainers. I was nervous, but the old knowledge was still there — the safety regs, the combustion equations, the knack for explaining complicated systems in plain language. The feedback came back positive: <em>He knows his stuff. He connects well. He’d make a good trainer.</em></p>
<p>The owner offered me a job — forty-three thousand a year, Monday to Friday, eight to five — but there was a condition. I’d need to pay for my re-qualification course up front. Once I passed, the job would be mine. I wanted to believe him, but something inside recoiled. I didn’t have that kind of money, and even if I did, it felt wrong that I should take all the risk while he took none. I tried to negotiate — maybe he could pay half and take the rest from my wages — but I couldn’t find the words. My anxiety scrambled everything. Later I learned he’d been burned before by someone else. His boundary was fixed. I had to respect it. But when I walked away, I felt like I’d failed again.</p>
<p>Spring came. The cold gave way to light. I went to the beach more often — sometimes just to sit, sometimes to swim. The cold water bit into my skin and made me feel alive. It was there, in May, that I met <strong>Rachel</strong>. She was sixty-eight, looked mid-fifties, confident, tanned, free. We got talking, discovered we both loved naturism, and before long we were spending time together — the beach, her flat, my house. After years of being unseen, I was suddenly seen, completely, even naked. It was healing at first.</p>
<p>But patterns have gravity. I began to notice how much I was giving, how little she offered back. I was her comfort, her novelty, her summer story. She once said she didn’t expect it to last more than eighteen months — that her looks would fade and I’d leave. I realised she was already halfway gone. When I finally left, it was quiet, no fight, just another goodbye that felt like relief.</p>
<p>Ten days later I met <strong>Frankie</strong>. Thirty-seven, newly divorced, recently back from Australia, no children, living with family. We met for coffee, walked around, and she practically threw herself into my arms. It was flattering, overwhelming, confusing. My body wanted closeness; my mind wanted caution. I left that first meeting uneasy, but I went back.</p>
<p>Between October 2023 and the spring of 2024, we were together. It was love mixed with labour. She was grieving her marriage, still entangled with her ex, using me as a place to collapse. I tried to hold her grief, to be the safe one again. The more I gave, the emptier I became. One night she lay next to me crying for her husband, and I knew I was finished. I told her she could do that on her own time. Then I left.</p>
<p>When it ended, I was wrecked — physically, emotionally, financially. I went back to the rhythm I knew: beach, home, beach, home, trying to heal under the sun. People kept telling me I was a good man, that I just needed to find the right person to receive what I offered. But all I felt was alone.</p>
<p>And then, one afternoon, I reinstalled Tinder. Two profiles stopped me. One was a woman too stunning to be real. The other was <strong>Jo</strong>. She wasn’t the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, but there was something in her eyes, in the way she wrote about herself — depth, self-awareness, something spiritual. I swiped right on both. When my phone buzzed a few minutes later, I knew instinctively it was her. <em>“Divergent thinker made me smile,”</em> she wrote. <em>“How are you?”</em></p>
</section>

<section id="ch9" class="chapter">
<h2>Chapter 9 – Meeting Jo (Summer 2024)</h2>
<p>We started messaging back and forth. Hours passed like minutes. For eight hours that first day, words bounced between us—curiosity, humour, stories. She said later that she could sense how wounded I was, that she could feel it through the screen. I was open about it. I told her I wasn’t going to get caught in another loop of over-giving. I said, <em>I’m done being the one who rescues while the other takes.</em> She replied, <em>Not all women are like that.</em></p>
<p>She told me she worked at J.P. Morgan as a Managing Director, that she earned a good salary and had built her own life from nothing after a brutal marriage breakdown. She said she wasn’t looking for a man to fund her, only someone she could actually connect with. That difference—her financial independence, her self-presentation as a woman who provided rather than took—disarmed me.</p>
<p>For three weeks we talked while she was away on holiday in a shepherd’s hut somewhere in Sussex. The GPS on Tinder had placed us sixteen kilometres apart, though in truth we were nearly a hundred miles away—she in London, me on the coast. Every day we wrote. Every day it grew. But when she came back from holiday, reality hit me: the distance.</p>
<p>One night I sat at my computer, pulled up Google Maps, and calculated it: two hours’ drive between us. I took a screenshot and sent it to her. I told her I liked her, that she seemed lovely, but that I couldn’t do another long-distance relationship. I said goodbye.</p>
<p>She didn’t accept it. The message landed, but instead of pulling away, she reached back. She said she didn’t want to lose me, that distance didn’t have to mean impossibility. Part of me knew she was right; another part of me knew I should stop before I was pulled in again. But neither of us let go.</p>
<p>Finally she suggested we meet halfway. “Box Hill?” she said. “I’ll drive an hour; you drive an hour.”</p>
<h3>Box Hill</h3>
<p>It was a warm day, high summer. I arrived first, parked, and saw her getting her boots out of the car. Blonde hair, black jeans, focused on her laces. She said later that she could feel my energy before she saw me. We started walking, winding through the hills and woods, talking about everything—childhood, work, belief, the things we’d survived.</p>
<p>It was during that walk she told me about her children. How she’d never bonded with her daughter. How her son had been conceived to spare the man she loved from the loneliness of being an only child. It was a strange confession for a first meeting, but I understood it: she wanted to be heard by someone who wouldn’t judge her. I listened.</p>
<p>We got lost and found our way back again. We laughed easily. When the café at the top closed, we sat on a bench, still talking. When it got dark we walked toward our cars. At the edge of the car park we stopped and hugged—a long, wordless, forty-five-minute embrace that neither of us wanted to end. Halfway through, rain started to fall, but neither of us moved.</p>
<p>I’d promised myself that this time would be different—no touching, no kissing, no sex for ninety days. I’d seen that advice somewhere, a way to break trauma loops and protect the heart. But there I was, standing in the rain, breaking the rule.</p>
<p>When we finally kissed, it was deep and electric. We were soaked through. I opened the boot of my car to grab towels—mostly kept there for Paddy, but clean. We dried ourselves, laughed, and kissed again. One thing led to another, the energy of the moment too strong to resist. There were people in the car park, horns honking, shouts of “Oi oi!”, but we barely noticed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, drenched and breathless, we said goodbye, got into our cars, and drove home. Neither of us remembered much of the drive—only the high of connection, the flood of chemicals, the feeling that something enormous had begun.</p>
<p>Over the next weeks we kept messaging, voice notes, phone calls that ran late into the night. Then she had a work trip to Bournemouth. Her job often took her there for meetings, overnight in hotels. She invited me to meet her. The trains were down that week, so I offered to pick her up in Winchester and drive us to Bournemouth. We reached the hotel and barely made it through the door before clothes were on the floor. Passionate, urgent, alive. We ordered room service, ate in bed, talked until we fell asleep in a bed the size of an island.</p>
<p>In the morning she went to her meetings and I drove home. She called me that evening, confused that she hadn’t asked me to stay. A day later her PA booked a car to drive her back to London. She thought about stopping to see me but couldn’t face it. I wanted her to come, but I was terrified of her seeing how bare my house was—just one furnished room, my bedroom. I didn’t want her to know how thin my life had become.</p>
<p>She drove past. It bothered her. She called that night and said she wished she’d come. A week later she did. She arrived by train. I picked her up, brought her home. I let her see the house, the emptiness. She didn’t flinch. She stayed six days—Zoom calls by day, conversation and closeness by night. When she left on Monday, a friend told her, “Six days? That’s a commitment for you.” The comment triggered her. Intimacy frightened her more than loneliness.</p>
<p>Within days she withdrew—quiet, distant, self-protecting. I recognised it. I called her and named it: dismissive-avoidant loops, the push–pull cycle. She said later the truth cracked her open. It also set the next year into motion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 – The Spiral (Autumn 2024 – 2025)</h2>
<p>When I held up the mirror, she froze—defence, justification, silence. The next day she admitted it: “You’re right.” I asked, “What are you going to do about it?” I should have left it there. Instead, when she asked to see me again, I agreed. She still had a bag at my house; I told myself she could collect it and go.</p>
<p>We met at a café by the beach. I had her bag in the boot, ready to hand over. She looked at me and said, “You’re right. I don’t want to keep perpetuating this pattern. I like you. I’m going to work with a therapist.” I wanted to believe her. I brought her home instead of letting her go.</p>
<p>That decision began the longest loop of my life. What unfolded wasn’t a normal relationship; it was two traumatised nervous systems colliding. Every conversation charged, every silence a wound, every reunion a balm that never lasted. She could be warm and brilliant, then suddenly vacant, as if a switch had been flipped. I tried to rescue us both with love, logic, and patience. Trauma didn’t care.</p>
<p>We cycled through closeness and collapse. She’d say, “You’re too intense.” I’d say, “You’re too distant.” Both true, both false. Months passed like this. I taught her what I knew about attachment and regulation. She thanked me, sometimes with tears, and then the pattern returned.</p>
<p>By early 2025 I was threadbare. My body flared—left side numb, head full of static. My finances bled. She oscillated between presence and disappearance. My nervous system couldn’t take one more round. Two Sundays ago I said, flat and final, “I’m done.” I told her she held the key. I told her the rest was her responsibility. Then I blocked her. At last, silence.</p>
